# employees-must-SQL

A database in postgres

## Description

For this module, we had to create several databases in postgres SQL that could then be added to and manipulated from a command line application. Most of the command line prompts that I've done up to this point have been fairly straight forward, a through line from start to end. This was the first time where there were possible branching paths, and where the actual application needed to be running until prompted otherwise. There was a fair amount of challenge in writing out the paths, as well as knowning when to have a separate query file and when to just run the SQL queries within the js file. At the end of the day, here is a solid way to keep track of a fictional employee database for a fabulously fictious drag company (note the punny names and lucrative salaries).

## Installation

To execute this command line application, running npm install inquirer 8.2.4 and npm install pg 8.11.5 are required to get this running, with dotenv 16.4.5 used to hide my postgres SQL credentials. Simply running npm i will install of these for you as well. 

## Usage

Running node index.js will initialize the application. The initial landing question will give you the options of seeing each of the three databases, creating a new department to add to the departments database, creating a new role to add to the roles database, creating a new employee to add to the employees database, updating an existing employee within the database, or quitting out of the application all together. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y1Cd7J7hQ7TUoKKS7kYDDZYGB9uObqD6/view
